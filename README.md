# Key Insights 
## Gender Distribution: 
Patient visits are balanced across genders, with slight variations in chronic conditions. Males lead in diabetes, while females show higher prevalence in asthma and hypertension, especially in older age groups.

## Age Trends:

Peak Visits: Young adults (18–29), primarily for asthma, diabetes, and hypertension.  
Decline with Age: Visits decrease gradually in middle and older age groups, reflecting chronic condition management.  

## Common Conditions:

Diabetes (12,986) and Hypertension (12,824) are most prevalent, necessitating focused care.  
Asthma (2,615), though less common, requires attention for chronic respiratory management.  
## Medications:

Statins, Metformin, and Lisinopril are equally prescribed, with many patients managing conditions without medication.  
"No Medication" group suggests emphasis on lifestyle interventions and preventive care.  
## Health Indicators:

Heart Rate: Mostly normal (60–100 bpm) with peaks due to stress or conditions like diabetes and hypertension.  
Cholesterol: Borderline high median indicates cardiovascular risk, requiring dietary and lifestyle adjustments.  
BMI: Median falls in the overweight range, highlighting the need for weight management across all ages.  
Lifestyle Risks: Smoking is prevalent across chronic conditions, amplifying health risks and emphasizing the need for cessation programs.  
## Healthcare Utilization:

Balanced across emergencies, routine check-ups, and follow-ups, reflecting comprehensive resource allocation.
